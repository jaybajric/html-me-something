                  <h2>Stage 1: Fresh</h2>
                  <p>The <b>fresh</b> body is dead moments after the heart stops beating,blood stops pumping and oxygen is depleted.Anaerobic bacteria proliferate, blisters appear on the skin, and flies arrive to the carcass.</p>

                    <h3>Stage 2:Bloat</h3>
                    <p>Anaerobic bacteria metabolize in the corpse, causing gas accumulation and thus, a <b>bloated</b> body.Gas leaving the body can cause lqiuids to become frothy and ruptures in the body. If insects made contact, maggots hatch and feed on the body, making ruptures that allow gas and fluid out, causing a noxious odor.</p>

                            <h4>Stage 3:Active Decay</h4>
                            <p><b>Active decay</b> is characterized by the period of greatest mass loss. This loss occurs as a result of both the voracious feeding of maggots and the purging of decomposition fluids into the surrounding environment. The purged fluids accumulate around the body and create a cadaver decomposition island (CDI). Liquefaction of tissues and disintegration become apparent during this time and strong odors persist.[6] The end of active decay is signaled by the migration of maggots away from the body to pupate.</p>

                                <h5>Stage 4:Advanced Decay</h5>
                                <p>Decomposition is largely inhibited during <b>advanced decay</b> due to the loss of readily available cadaveric material. Insect activity is also reduced during this stage. When the carcass is located on soil, the area surrounding it will show evidence of vegetation death. The CDI surrounding the carcass will display an increase in soil carbon and nutrients, such as phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium changes in pH; and a significant increase in soil nitrogen.</p>

                                    <p>During the <b>dry/remains stage</b>, the resurgence of plant growth around the CDI may occur and is a sign that the nutrients present in the surrounding soil have not yet returned to their normal levels. All that remains of the cadaver at this stage is dry skin, cartilage, and bones, which will become dry and bleached if exposed to the elements. If all soft tissue is removed from the cadaver, it is referred to as completely skeletonized, but if only portions of the bones are exposed, it is referred to as partially skeletonised.</p>
